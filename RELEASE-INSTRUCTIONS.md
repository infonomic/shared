# Package Changset and Release Instructions

## I: Auto flow with GitHub action:

NOTE: This flow will use a GitHub action to version packages based on a pending changeset in the .changeset directory, and then create a PR to be merged after manual review. Once the PR has been accepted, the action will then publish the package to NPM - currently using a token from the 58bits NPM account (expires in 20 years, and only has access to the @infonomic/shared repo).

1. `pnpm changeset`

Choose packages to version with major, minor or patch releases.
Write a summary for the change set.

2. Git commit the change set to main and push.

3. The github action will create a pull request for the changeset

4. Manually review and accept the PR - the github action will then publish to npm.

NOTE: the auto-flow GitHub action will also create a Releases entry in the repo as well as attach zipped binaries.

IMPORTANT: It's important that everyone then git fetches, git pulls the latest from the main branch of the repo, and merges / rebases their local branches to bring them up to date with the release.

## II Manual flow:

NOTE: you'll need to log in to NPM on the command line before starting: `npm login`

1. `pnpm changeset`

Choose packages to version with major, minor or patch releases.
Write a summary for the change set.

2. `pnpm version-packages`

This will call changeset version, updating all package.json versions and updating release notes. It will also clear / remove the pending changeset from the .changeset directory.

3. `pnpm release:npm`

This will build the uikit package, and then call changeset publish. It will publish to npm via whatever account you've authenticated locally with via `npm login`.

NOTE: The manual flow will not create a Releases entry in the repo (and therefore not create any attached zip binaries).
